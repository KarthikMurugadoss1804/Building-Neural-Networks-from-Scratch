# Building Neural Networks from Scratch
 Implements image classification functions such as forward pass, activation functions, performance calculators from scratch and compares with high level keras api

For this repository, the work has been are divided into mutliple notebooks. Each repository performs an objective as outlined in the problem statement pdf.

## Project Outline:

1.  Part 1_1 builds a softmax classifier and implements the following functions:
    
    1.  forward_pass
    2.  cross_entrophy
    3.  calculate_accuracy
2.  Part 1_2_1 and Part 1_2_2 build two different architectures with ReLu
    
3.  Part 1_3 Adds L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization to the above architectures.
    
4.  Part B - Compares the Above (scratch implementation) with the high level Keras API using TensorFlow.
